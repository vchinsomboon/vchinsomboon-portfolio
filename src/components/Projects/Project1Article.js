                    <p>
                        The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. One of the key factors that determined survival was whether passengers possessed certain characteristics that significantly influenced their chances of survival. This project aims to predict the survival of passengers based on various features available in the dataset.

                        <strong>Survival Rate by Passenger Class:</strong><br />
                        Passengers in 1st class had the highest survival rate.<br />
                        Passengers in 2nd class had a lower survival rate.<br />
                        Passengers in 3rd class had the lowest survival rate.<br />
                        <strong>Chi2 test for Passenger Class:</strong><br />
                        Chi2: 102.89, p-value: 4.549e-23<br />
                        Result: The relationship between Passenger Class and survival is significant (Reject H0)

                    <p>
                        <strong>Survival Rate by Sex:</strong><br />
                        Females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.<br />
                        <strong>Chi2 test for Sex:</strong><br />
                        Chi2: 260.72, p-value: 1.197e-58<br />
                        Result: The relationship between Sex and survival is significant (Reject H0)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Survival Rate by Fare:</strong><br />
                        Passengers who paid higher fares generally had higher survival rates.<br />
                        The highest survival rate was observed among those who paid fares between 50 and 100, and 100 and 600.<br />
                        <strong>Chi2 test for Fare:</strong><br />
                        Chi2: 425.81, p-value: 1.165e-11<br />
                        Result: The relationship between Fare and survival is significant (Reject H0)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Survival Rate by Age:</strong><br />
                        Children aged 0-10 had a higher survival rate.<br />
                        Survival rates decreased with age. Older age groups (70-80) had lower survival rates.<br />
                        <strong>Chi2 test for Age:</strong><br />
                        Chi2: 104.16, p-value: 0.101<br />
                        Result: The relationship between Age and survival is not significant (Fail to reject H0)<br />
                        Note: This means that while there is an observable trend where children had higher survival rates and older adults had lower survival rates, the statistical test suggests that this relationship could have occurred by random chance and may not be significant in predicting survival solely based on age.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Survival Rate by Embarked:</strong><br />
                        Passengers who embarked at 'C' (Cherbourg) had the highest survival rate.<br />
                        Passengers who embarked at 'Q' (Queenstown) had a moderate survival rate.<br />
                        Passengers who embarked at 'S' (Southampton) had the lowest survival rate.<br />

                    <p>
                        <strong>Survival Rate by Family Size:</strong><br />
                        Passengers with a family size of 1-3 had higher survival rates.<br />
                        Larger family sizes (5-6) had lower survival rates.<br />
                        Passengers with no family (family size of 0) had a moderate survival rate.<br />
                        Very large family sizes (7 and above) had lower survival rates.<br />

                    <h2>3. Data Preprocessing</h2>
                    <p>
                        Before constructing the model, data preprocessing is essential. This process includes managing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Handling Missing Values:</h3>
                    <p>We replace missing numerical values with their mean, and for categorical values, we fill them with the most frequent value.</p>

                    <h3>Encoding Categorical Variables:</h3>
                    <p>We convert categorical variables such as 'Sex' and 'Embarked' into numerical values using one-hot encoding, dropping the first category to avoid multicollinearity.</p>

                    <h3>Feature Scaling:</h3>
                    <p>Numerical features such as 'Age' and 'Fare' are scaled to a range of 0 to 1 using Min-Max scaling to ensure uniformity in scale.</p>

                    <p>
                        Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Creating New Features:</h3>
                    <p>We can create new features such as 'Family Size' by combining 'SibSp' and 'Parch'. Another useful feature is 'IsAlone', which indicates whether a passenger is traveling alone if their 'FamilySize' is 1.</p>

                        With the data preprocessed and features engineered, we can now build our machine learning model. We will use a variety of algorithms to find the best model for our problem.

                    </ul>
                    <p>We split the training data into training and validation sets to evaluate the performance of each model.
                        We employed grid search with cross-validation to identify the best-performing model. Grid search systematically evaluates combinations of hyperparameters specified in parameter grids, ensuring optimal model performance across various configurations.

                    <p>
                        We evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The confusion matrix provides additional insights into the performance of our models.

                    <img src={rf_CM} alt="RF Confusion Matrix" style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '800px' }} />
                    <p>Based on the evaluation metrics, the Random Forest model achieved a higher test set accuracy of 83% compared to the Decision Tree's 80%. It also demonstrated balanced precision, recall, and F1-score across survival and non-survival predictions, indicating superior performance in capturing true positives while minimizing false negatives. These results affirm the Random Forest model's effectiveness and reliability in predicting Titanic survival, thereby influencing its selection over the Decision Tree model for this study.</p>
